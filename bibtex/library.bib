annote = {Interesting paper. Authors assert that people make predictions by using distributions for analogous quantities they have experience about and essentially use Bayesian inference from there, but may be mistaken about the prior. For example, they ask people to predict the reign of a Pharaoh: people use a good distribution for lifetimes, but perhaps fail to adjust the mean of the distribution (since people had shorter lifespans then).

        
Good example of Bayesian influence on Cog. Sci.

        
Makes me wonder about the current state of the art for models that summarise and connect topics and, more specifically, bits of knowledge from text corpora. (In other words, I want something to help summarise the relationships and importance of research papers.) :-)

abstract = {The well-known PRETREE model, though rich in behavioral structural theory, is virtually unused by marketing practitioners. Four problem areas relating to the ap- plication of PRETREE are identified. The authors then develop the "elimination-by- dimensions" (EBD) model to address these problems. A key feature of the EBD model is the recognition that most real-life marketing attributes are continuous di- mensions, not aspects. The EBD model provides diagnostic information by labeling the specific dimensions consumers use to eliminate alternatives hierarchically. A pro- cedure for naming the key dimensions directly from the data is suggested. Empirical information from both an industrial buying dataset and a consumer product dataset is used to compare the predicted market share estimates of the EBD model with predictions based on Tversky and Sattath's suggested conditional probability ap- proach and the multinomial logit model. The EBD model gives substantially better market share predictions on both datasets than the conditional probability ap- proach. Finally, using only dimensions identified by the disaggregate EBD model, the authors show individual-level predictions to be significantly above the chance level.},
annote = {First apply factor analysis, then take some dimensions to construct the PreTree and use EBA on this model. I{\&}{\#}039;m not convinced that this is better than PreTree. 

        
I do not entirely agree with some statements of the paper, especially that there did not exist a method to transfer the binary choice probabilities of EBA to multiple choice probabilities. This claim does not make sense since EBA is defined for multiple choice situations. Maybe they mean that binary comparison data is not enough to learn the full feature matrix and therefore not enough to infer the multiple choice probabilities? },

abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.},

@article{Jiao2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput sequencing allows the detection and quantification of frequencies of somatic single nucleotide variants (SNV) in heterogeneous tumor cell populations. In some cases, the evolutionary history and population frequency of the subclonal lineages of tumor cells present in the sample can be reconstructed from these SNV frequency measurements. But automated methods to do this reconstruction are not available and the conditions under which reconstruction is possible have not been described. RESULTS: We describe the conditions under which the evolutionary history can be uniquely reconstructed from SNV frequencies from single or multiple samples from the tumor population and we introduce a new statistical model, PhyloSub, that infers the phylogeny and genotype of the major subclonal lineages represented in the population of cancer cells. It uses a Bayesian nonparametric prior over trees that groups SNVs into major subclonal lineages and automatically estimates the number of lineages and their ancestry. We sample from the joint posterior distribution over trees to identify evolutionary histories and cell population frequencies that have the highest probability of generating the observed SNV frequency data. When multiple phylogenies are consistent with a given set of SNV frequencies, PhyloSub represents the uncertainty in the tumor phylogeny using a "partial order plot". Experiments on a simulated dataset and two real datasets comprising tumor samples from acute myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients demonstrate that PhyloSub can infer both linear (or chain) and branching lineages and its inferences are in good agreement with ground truth, where it is available. CONCLUSIONS: PhyloSub can be applied to frequencies of any "binary" somatic mutation, including SNVs as well as small insertions and deletions. The PhyloSub and partial order plot software is available from https://github.com/morrislab/phylosub/.},

abstract = {Primary triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), a tumour type defined by lack of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and ERBB2 gene amplification, represent approximately 16{\%} of all breast cancers. Here we show in 104 TNBC cases that at the time of diagnosis these cancers exhibit a wide and continuous spectrum of genomic evolution, with some having only a handful of coding somatic aberrations in a few pathways, whereas others contain hundreds of coding somatic mutations. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that only approximately 36{\%} of mutations are expressed. Using deep re-sequencing measurements of allelic abundance for 2,414 somatic mutations, we determine for the first time-to our knowledge-in an epithelial tumour subtype, the relative abundance of clonal frequencies among cases representative of the population. We show that TNBCs vary widely in their clonal frequencies at the time of diagnosis, with the basal subtype of TNBC showing more variation than non-basal TNBC. Although p53 (also known as TP53), PIK3CA and PTEN somatic mutations seem to be clonally dominant compared to other genes, in some tumours their clonal frequencies are incompatible with founder status. Mutations in cytoskeletal, cell shape and motility proteins occurred at lower clonal frequencies, suggesting that they occurred later during tumour progression. Taken together, our results show that understanding the biology and therapeutic responses of patients with TNBC will require the determination of individual tumour clonal genotypes.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an information theoretic criterion for comparing two partitions, or clusterings, of the same data set. The criterion, called variation of information (VI), measures the amount of information lost and gained in changing from clustering C to clustering C′. The basic properties of VI are presented and discussed. We focus on two kinds of properties: (1) those that help one build intuition about the new criterion (in particular, it is shown the VI is a true metric on the space of clusterings), and (2) those that pertain to the comparability of VI values over different experimental conditions. As the latter properties have rarely been discussed explicitly before, other existing comparison criteria are also examined in their light. Finally we present the VI from an axiomatic point of view, showing that it is the only “sensible” criterion for comparing partitions that is both aligned to the lattice and convexely additive. As a consequence, we prove an impossibility result for comparing partitions: there is no criterion for comparing partitions that simultaneously satisfies the above two desirable properties and is bounded.},

Other consequences of the sampling formulae are Brownian representions of various special functions, including Bessel polynomials, some hypergeometric polynomials, and the Hermite function. Various combinatorial identities involving random partitions and generalized Stirling numbers are also obtained.},

abstract = {A plausible representation of the relational information among entities in dynamic systems such as a living cell or a social community is a stochastic network that is topologically rewiring and semantically evolving over time. Although there is a rich literature in modeling static or temporally invariant networks, little has been done toward recovering the network structure when the networks are not observable in a dynamic context. In this article, we present a machine learning method called TESLA, which builds on a temporally smoothed l(1)-regularized logistic regression formalism that can be cast as a standard convex-optimization problem and solved efficiently by using generic solvers scalable to large networks. We report promising results on recovering simulated time-varying networks and on reverse engineering the latent sequence of temporally rewiring political and academic social networks from longitudinal data, and the evolving gene networks over >4,000 genes during the life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster from a microarray time course at a resolution limited only by sample frequency.},

abstract = {The identification and modeling of patterns of human activity have important ramifications for applications ranging from predicting disease spread to optimizing resource allocation. Because of its relevance and availability, written correspondence provides a powerful proxy for studying human activity. One school of thought is that human correspondence is driven by responses to received correspondence, a view that requires a distinct response mechanism to explain e-mail and letter correspondence observations. We demonstrate that, like e-mail correspondence, the letter correspondence patterns of 16 writers, performers, politicians, and scientists are well described by the circadian cycle, task repetition, and changing communication needs. We confirm the universality of these mechanisms by rescaling letter and e-mail correspondence statistics to reveal their underlying similarity.},

abstract = {We propose a multiresolution Gaussian process to capture long-range, non-Markovian dependencies while allowing for abrupt changes. The multiresolution GP hierarchically couples a collection of smooth GPs, each defined over an element of a random nested partition. Long-range dependencies are captured by the top-level GP while the partition points define the abrupt changes. Due to the inherent conjugacy of the GPs, one can analytically marginalize the GPs and compute the conditional likelihood of the observations given the partition tree. This property allows for efficient inference of the partition itself, for which we employ graph-theoretic techniques. We apply the multiresolution GP to the analysis of Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of brain activity.},

@article{KnudsenMiyamoto07,
abstract = {Coalescent theory provides a powerful framework for estimating the evolutionary, demographic, and genetic parameters of a population from a small sample of individuals. Current coalescent models have largely focused on population genetic factors (e.g., mutation, population growth, and migration) rather than on the effects of experimental design and error. This study develops a new coalescent/mutation model that accounts for unobserved polymorphisms due to missing data, sequence errors, and multiple reads for diploid individuals. The importance of accommodating these effects of experimental design and error is illustrated with evolutionary simulations and a real data set from a population of the California sea hare. In particular, a failure to account for sequence errors can lead to overestimated mutation rates, inflated coalescent times, and inappropriate conclusions about the population. This current model can now serve as a starting point for the development of newer models with additional experimental and population genetic factors. It is currently implemented as a maximum-likelihood method, but this model may also serve as the basis for the development of Bayesian approaches that incorporate experimental design and error.},

abstract = {We show that it is possible to extend hidden Markov models to have a countably infinite number of hidden states. By using the theory of Dirichlet processes we can implicitly integrate out the infinitely many transition parameters, leaving only three hyperparameters which can be learned from data. These three hyperparameters define a hierarchical Dirichlet process capable of capturing a rich set of transition dynamics. The three hyperparameters control the time scale of the dynamics, the sparsity of the underlying state-transition matrix, and the expected number of distinct hidden states in a finite sequence. In this framework it is also natural to allow the alphabet of emitted symbols to be infinite - consider, for example, symbols being possible words appearing in English text.},

abstract = {We present an extension to the Mixture of Experts (ME) model, where the individual experts are Gaussian Process (GP) regression models. Using a input-dependent adaptation of the Dirichlet Process, we implement a gating network for an infinite number of Experts. Inference in this model may be done efficiently using a Markov Chain relying on Gibbs sampling. The model allows the effective covariance function to vary with the inputs, and may handle large datasets -- thus potentially overcoming two of the biggest hurdles with GP models. Simulations show the viability of this approach.},

from arbitrary density functions using adaptive rejection sampling without
the log-concavity requirement. The method makes use of the fact
that a function can be expressed as a sum of concave and convex functions.
Using a concave convex decomposition, we bound the log-density
using piecewise linear functions for and use the upper bound as the sampling
distribution. We use the same function decomposition approach to
approximate integrals which requires only a slight change in the sampling
algorithm.

abstract = {We have developed a Bayesian version of our likelihood-based Markov chain Monte Carlo genealogy sampler LAMARC and compared the two versions for estimation of theta = 4N(e)mu, exponential growth rate, and recombination rate. We used simulated DNA data to assess accuracy of means and support or credibility intervals. In all cases the two methods had very similar results. Some parameter combinations led to overly narrow support or credibility intervals, excluding the truth more often than the desired percentage, for both methods. However, the Bayesian approach rejected the generative parameter values significantly less often than the likelihood approach, both in cases where the level of rejection was normal and in cases where it was too high.},

abstract = {We developed a mathematical model, which makes possible to predict joint distributions of numbers of mismatches in two or more linked regions of the genome, based on the Infinite Sites Models, under mutation-drift equilibrium as well as under various patterns of population growth. With mutation rates varying in the region, one of the predictions is different correlation between numbers of mismatches in the two regions, depending on the pattern of the past population growth (constant, slowly growing, or rapidly growing). Also, for slower growth patterns of population sizes, the coalescence tree is not necessarily 'starlike'. Thus, the joint distribution of mismatches, predicted by the model, provides additional insights into the demographic history of the populations. We also developed expectations and variances of sample statistics under different growth scenarios. As an application we used a sample of mitochondrial sequences from hypervariable regions 1 and 2 (HV1 and HV2), representing major world populations (Europeans, Asians and Africans). The patterns of joint distributions of numbers of mismatches differ markedly from one population to another. In addition, there is a considerable variability in the proportion of numbers of mismatches between HV1 and HV2 sequences. The patterns of bivariate distributions from the HV1 and HV2 data in these data are consistent with those generated by the model involving a stepwise change in population size.},

abstract = {We study the dynamic network of e-mail traffic and find that it develops self-organized coherent structures similar to those appearing in many nonlinear dynamic systems. Such structures are uncovered by a general information theoretic approach to dynamic networks based on the analysis of synchronization among trios of users. In the e-mail network, coherent structures arise from temporal correlations when users act in a synchronized manner. These temporally linked structures turn out to be functional, goal-oriented aggregates that must react in real time to changing objectives and challenges (e.g., committees at a university). In contrast, static structures turn out to be related to organizational units (e.g., departments).},

abstract = {Mixtures of Dirichlet Processes (MDP) have been widely used as a method of
overcoming the discreteness of the Dirichlet Process (DP). The two approaches taken
to sample from the Dirichlet measure are: the marginal approach (Escobar and West
1995) where the measure is integrated out within the Gibbs sampler via a clever use
of the Polya Urn construction of the DP and the conditional approach (see Ishwaran
and Zarepour 2000, 2002) which makes use of the infinite sum construction of the DP
(see Sethuraman 1994). The ways around this infinite sum construction are either
approximations or truncations (Ishwaran and Zarepour 2000) or using the
retrospective sampler (see Papaspiliopoulos and Roberts 2005). The retrospective
sampler deals with the infinite sum directly, via use of reversible jump steps. We
introduce a simpler sampler, which instead of using reversible jumps, introduces an
auxiliary variable and incorporates the slice sampler within the construction of the
posteriors for the Gibbs sampler (see P. Damien, J. Wakefield, S.G.Walker 1999).
The new algorithm works with the infinite sum construction of the DP from the very
beginning and by introducing auxiliary variables the Gibbs sampler updating is done
within finite sets.},

We call such algorithms annealed importance sampling reversible jump (aisRJ). The proposed procedures can be thought of as being exact approximations of idealized RJ algorithms which in a model selection problem would sample the model labels only, but cannot be implemented. Central to the methodology is the idea of bridging different models with fictitious intermediate models, whose role is to introduce smooth intermodel transitions and, as we shall see, improve performance. Efficiency of the resulting algorithms is demonstrated on two standard model selection problems and we show that despite the additional computational effort incurred, the approach can be highly competitive computationally.

abstract = {Changes in population size influence genetic diversity of the population and, as a result, leave a signature of these changes in individual genomes in the population. We are interested in the inverse problem of reconstructing past population dynamics from genomic data. We start with a standard framework based on the coalescent, a stochastic process that generates genealogies connecting randomly sampled individuals from the population of interest. These genealogies serve as a glue between the population demographic history and genomic sequences. It turns out that only the times of genealogical lineage coalescences contain information about population size dynamics. Viewing these coalescent times as a point process, estimating population size trajectories is equivalent to estimating a conditional intensity of this point process. Therefore, our inverse problem is similar to estimating an inhomogeneous Poisson process intensity function. We demonstrate how recent advances in Gaussian process-based nonparametric inference for Poisson processes can be extended to Bayesian nonparametric estimation of population size dynamics under the coalescent. We compare our Gaussian process (GP) approach to one of the state of the art Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) methods for estimating population trajectories. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that our method has better accuracy and precision. Next, we analyze two genealogies reconstructed from real sequences of hepatitis C and human Influenza A viruses. In both cases, we recover more believed aspects of the viral demographic histories than the GMRF approach. We also find that our GP method produces more reasonable uncertainty estimates than the GMRF method.},

abstract = {Despite efforts to recruit and retain more women, a stark gender disparity persists within academic science. Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student-who was randomly assigned either a male or female name-for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. We also assessed faculty participants' preexisting subtle bias against women using a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less support for the female student, but was unrelated to reactions to the male student. These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.},

abstract = {The problem of inferring a clustering of a data set has been the subject of much research in Bayesian analysis, and there currently exists a solid mathematical foundation for Bayesian approaches to clustering. In particular, the class of probability distributions over partitions of a data set has been characterized in a number of ways, including via exchangeable partition probability functions (EPPFs) and the Kingman paintbox. Here, we develop a generalization of the clustering problem, called feature allocation, where we allow each data point to belong to an arbitrary, non-negative integer number of groups, now called features or topics. We define and study an "exchangeable feature probability function" (EFPF)---analogous to the EPPF in the clustering setting---for certain types of feature models. Moreover, we introduce a "feature paintbox" characterization---analogous to the Kingman paintbox for clustering---of the class of exchangeable feature models. We provide a further characterization of the subclass of feature allocations that have EFPF representations.},

When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

abstract = {This article reviews Bayesian inference from the perspective that the designated model is misspecified. This misspecification has implications in interpretation of objects, such as the prior distribution, which has been the cause of recent questioning of the appropriateness of Bayesian inference in this scenario. The main focus of this article is to establish the suitability of applying the Bayes update to a misspecified model, and relies on representation theorems for sequences of symmetric distributions; the identification of parameter values of interest; and the construction of sequences of distributions which act as the guesses as to where the next observation is coming from. A conclusion is that a clear identification of the fundamental starting point for the Bayesian is described.},

@article{Broderick2012,
abstract = {The classical mixture of Gaussians model is related to K-means via small-variance asymptotics: as the covariances of the Gaussians tend to zero, the negative log-likelihood of the mixture of Gaussians model approaches the K-means objective, and the EM algorithm approaches the K-means algorithm. Kulis {\&} Jordan (2012) used this observation to obtain a novel K-means-like algorithm from a Gibbs sampler for the Dirichlet process (DP) mixture. We instead consider applying small-variance asymptotics directly to the posterior in Bayesian nonparametric models. This framework is independent of any specific Bayesian inference algorithm, and it has the major advantage that it generalizes immediately to a range of models beyond the DP mixture. To illustrate, we apply our framework to the feature learning setting, where the beta process and Indian buffet process provide an appropriate Bayesian nonparametric prior. We obtain a novel objective function that goes beyond clustering to learn (and penalize new) groupings for which we relax the mutual exclusivity and exhaustivity assumptions of clustering. We demonstrate several other algorithms, all of which are scalable and simple to implement. Empirical results demonstrate the benefits of the new framework.},

abstract = {Many exact Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms have been developed for posterior inference in Bayesian nonparametric models which involve infinite-dimensional priors. However, these methods are not generic and special methodology must be developed for different classes of prior or different models. Alternatively, the infinite-dimensional prior can be truncated and standard Markov chain Monte Carlo methods used for inference. However, the error in approximating the infinite-dimensional posterior can be hard to control for many models. This paper describes an adaptive truncation method which allows the level of the truncation to be decided by the algorithm and so can avoid large errors in approximating the posterior. A sequence of truncated priors is constructed which are sampled using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods embedded in a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm. Implementation for infinite mixture models with stick-breaking priors and normalized random measures with independent increments priors is discussed. The methodology is illustrated on infinite mixture models, a semiparametric linear mixed model and a nonparametric time series model.},

@misc{Plummer2006,
abstract = {[1st paragraph] At first sight, Bayesian inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) appears to be straightforward. The user defines a full probability model, perhaps using one of the programs discussed in this issue; an underlying sampling engine takes the model definition and returns a sequence of dependent samples from the posterior distribution of the model parameters, given the supplied data. The user can derive any summary of the posterior distribution from this sample. For example, to calculate a 95{\%} credible interval for a parameter $\alpha$, it suffices to take 1000 MCMC iterations of $\alpha$ and sort them so that $\alpha$121000. The credible interval estimate is then ($\alpha$25, $\alpha$975). However, there is a price to be paid for this simplicity. Unlike most numerical methods used in statistical inference, MCMC does not give a clear indication of whether it has converged. The underlying Markov chain theory only guarantees that the distribution of the output will converge to the posterior in the limit as the number of iterations increases to infinity. The user is generally ignorant about how quickly convergence occurs, and therefore has to fall back on post hoc testing of the sampled output. By convention, the sample is divided into two parts: a “burn in” period during which all samples are discarded, and the remainder of the run in which the chain is considered to have converged sufficiently close to the limiting distribution to be used. Two questions then arise: 1. How long should the burn in period be? 2. How many samples are required to accurately estimate posterior quantities of interest? The coda package for R contains a set of functions designed to help the user answer these questions. Some of these convergence diagnostics are simple graphical ways of summarizing the data. Others are formal statistical tests.},

@article{Murray2012,
abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo is a widely-used technique for generating a dependent sequence of samples from complex distributions. Conventionally, these methods require a source of independent random variates. Most implementations use pseudo-random numbers instead because generating true independent variates with a physical system is not straightforward. In this paper we show how to modify some commonly used Markov chains to use a dependent stream of random numbers in place of independent uniform variates. The resulting Markov chains have the correct invariant distribution without requiring detailed knowledge of the stream's dependencies or even its marginal distribution. As a side-effect, sometimes far fewer random numbers are required to obtain accurate results.},

@article{Pritchard2000,
abstract = {We describe a model-based clustering method for using multilocus genotype data to infer population structure and assign individuals to populations. We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci--e.g., seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species. The software used for this article is available from http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/{\~{}}pritch/home.html.},
